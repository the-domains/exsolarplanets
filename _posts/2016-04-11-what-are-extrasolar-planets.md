  An exoplanet or extrasolar planet is a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun. Over 2000 exoplanets have been discovered since 1988 (more specifically, 2107 planets in 1349 planetary systems, including 511 multiple planetary systems, have been confirmed, as of 2 April 2016).

An **exoplanet** or **extrasolar planet** is a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun. Over 2000 exoplanets have been discovered since 1988 (more specifically, 2107 planets in 1349 planetary systems, including 511 multiple planetary systems, have been confirmed, as of 2 April 2016).

HARPS (since 2004) has discovered about a hundred exoplanets while the Kepler space telescope (since 2009) has already found more than a thousand. Kepler has also detected a few thousand[\[][0]candidate planets, of which about 11% may be false positives. On average, there is at least one planet per star, with a percentage having multiple planets. About 1 in 5 Sun-like stars have an "Earth-sized" planet in the habitable zone, with the nearest expected to be within 12 light-years distance from Earth. Assuming 200 billion stars in the Milky Way,[\[d\]][1]
that would be 11 billion potentially habitable Earth-sized planets in 
the Milky Way, rising to 40 billion if planets orbiting the numerous red[][2]dwarfs are included

The least massive planet known is PSR B1257+12 A, also known as Draugr, which is about twice the mass of the Moon. The most massive planet listed on the NASA Exoplanet Archive is DENIS-P J082303.1-491201[][3]b, about 29 times the mass of Jupiter, although according to most definitions of a planet, it is too massive to be a planet and may be a brown dwarf
instead. There are planets that are so near to their star that they 
take only a few hours to orbit and there are others so far away that 
they take thousands of years to orbit. Some are so far out that it is 
difficult to tell whether they are gravitationally bound to the star. 
Almost all of the planets detected so far are within the Milky Way, but 
there have also been a few possible detection's of extragalactic planets.
